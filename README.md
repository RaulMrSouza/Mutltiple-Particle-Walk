# Mutltiple-Particle-Walk

The Multiple Particle Competition and Cooperation or Multiple Particle Walk algorithm
 is a semi-supervised classification model.
 
It is a modified version of the original Particle Competition and Cooperation algorithm, see the reference
for more information about the original.

The difference in this version is that each labeled sample will generate multiple 
particles instead of one and there is only random walk movement.
